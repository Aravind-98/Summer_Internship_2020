# Literature Review of **Index Tracking Based on Deep Neural Network-Ouyang et al**

*Note: The data used here was that of the Hang-Seng Index(HSI)*

* [2,3,4,5,6,7] analytical framework
* [8] uses metaheuristic algorithms like Genetic Algorithm for optimization while stock selection is done with Fundamental Analysis
* [10:15] use NNs and SVMs to achieve better performance
* [18]-Heaton's paper(The primary basis of this paper). They develop a deep portfolio, with the exception of not determining the stock weights, which the authors of this paper account for.

## Brief Overview of the Methodology
The problem is broken down into 2 stages: stock selection and weight allocation.
1) The stock selection problem is addressed by using what's known as a **Deep AutoEncoder**.
In a sense it can be viewed as PCA's non-linear counterpart. The basic idea is straightforward as it is.
The input is X=[x_1,x_2,...,x_n] where each **x_i is the 'Adj closing price' time series of the ith stock**. This input is compressed to lower-dimensional form by a hidden layer of neurons in the middle and then expanded again back to original dimensions. There is some loss of information here, due to compression process. We train the network in such a manner that this loss of information mainly accounts for the statistical noise.
Due to non-linearity, this is generally more powerful than the PCA. 

*It is an unsupervised learning problem where the input is trained on itself (ie X_hat=F(X)).*

The low-dimensional encoded data Z generated by the encoder process equation can be
considered as the market portfolio composed of n stocks and contains the nonlinear interactive effect
between different stocks. The output data X (i.e., the data after decoding) generated by equation
reflects the nonlinear impact of market portfolio on different stocks.

Further some similarities and distinctions are drawn between CAPM and this process.
I intend to use a sequence to sequence LSTM autoencoder which I assume would perform better given that it accounts for time-dependencies across our time series data.
In my case, I plan to use a data vector as input of each time-step, this 1-d vector has #number_of_stocks(n) number of elements in it(46) in our case.

Once we have the denoised representation of out data, the author then focuses on finding the similarity between each stock and it's denoised representation. He computes this by simply taking **d_i=(||x_i - x_i_hat ||)^(2)**
He then takes the 'h' most similar stocks and 'l' least similar stocks such that h<l.

This finishes the stock selection process.

2) The author trains a standard Deep Neural Network and devises a method to compute the weights used by taking non-linear activations like 'ReLU' for convenience to compute the weights of the corresponding stocks.
I have tried the same using a RNN based approach to account for time-dependence. However as a drawback, owing to the complications of my model, I wouldn't be able to find the weights
